What is the Boost wallet?
----------------

Boost wallet is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Boost wallet uses peer-to-peer technology to operate

out collectively by the network. Boost wallet is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.
